# SCII: Agents clash

Second Hand-in: Use the library pySC2 to make two agents battle each other. For the time being there are two agents, [terran agent](terran.md) (which was Hand-in I) and, for the time being, a basic protoss agent. 
### How to use it:

Use the following command to see the two agents mentioned above battle:
    
    python terranAgent.py

The complete documentation and further improvement to the protoss agent are a work in process...
